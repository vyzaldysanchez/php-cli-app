# php-cli-app
CLI app developed in PHP

This app is intended to be just for practicing and improving PHP skills at developing CLI applications.

First of them all, you should have installed [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) (version 7 or higher). 
You should also have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed.

Now, just install all composer deps by running in your command line:
`composer install`

To run this app ensure the file *cli-app* have executing permissions, then just run `./cli-app greet YOUR-NAME` to see the results.

Happy Coding!! :computer: :heart:
